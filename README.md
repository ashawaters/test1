## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[During this submission I at first did not understand HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and worried it would be an issue when completing the project. I did not understand the some of the syntax and was confused as to why I kept recieving errors/red dots in my lines of code. I re-read the prework instructions and also explored the glitch website to see if I could find a pattern in the languages. I was able to see a pattern and it helped me understand the basics of each language. From that point I had no further problems with understanding the programming languages. Another issue I encountered was my program being unable to produce sound. I carefully reviewed both my code and instructions to verify that I had not made any mistakes. It turned out I did not include a bracket for the audio portion of code causing it not to work. Overall, this project was a challenge because I was unfamilar with the programming languages, but it was a learning experience that has allowed me to feel more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript now.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this project I am now curious about web development. I would like to know what are the most common porgramming languages for websites. How do HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together to make this game work even though they are completely differnt coding languages.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on the assignment there are a few things I would have done differently. I would have changed the design of the game including aspects such as font size, button size, and colors of the buttons. I also would ahve added a timer so players can keep track of how much time has passed or how much time they have remaining in the game. One more thing I would do is change the frequencies of the audio to higher or lower pitches.]
